## Technical Report

#### Overall, our team didn't face many technical issues during the project, which was great. The main challenge we ran into was **merge conflicts**. It wasn't a huge problem, but it did require careful attention and communication to make sure nothing was lost.  

#### Most of the conflicts happened in the `index.html` file because it was the core file that everyone touched. For example, one team member updated a section heading and pushed their changes through a pull request, while another person made edits to the same lines in their own branch. To handle this, the second member first **pulled the latest `develop` branch** to make sure they had all the recent changes. Then, they **merged `develop` into their feature branch**, carefully reviewed the conflicts, and resolved them manually by combining or adjusting the edits. Once everything looked correct, they merged the feature branch back into `develop`.  

#### The **pull request and peer review process** really helped our team work smoothly and keep our code clean. Before anything was merged into `develop`, someone else reviewed it for mistakes, coding style, and overall quality. This prevented accidental errors and kept the workflow organized. Reviews also sparked useful discussions and suggestions, which improved both the code and our teamwork.
